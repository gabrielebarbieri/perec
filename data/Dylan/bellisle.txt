One evenin' for pleasure
I rappled with you
In the fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loche Erin
Where the beauty and pleasure were known
I spied a fair maiden and her neighbor
Which caused me to stay for awhile
And I thooght of her goddes of beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Brighte Isle

l humbled myself to her beauty
Fair maiden where do you belong
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding cupid's bare throne
Young man I will teII you a secret
It's true l'm a maid that's poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
'Tis more than my heert can endure
Therefore I remain at my service
And go through with my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle

Young maiden I wish not to banter
'Tis true I come here in disguise
l came here to fulfill my last promise
And hope to give you a surprise
l know you're a maid I Iove dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsell
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle
