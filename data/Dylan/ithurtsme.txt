So run here baby
Put your little hands in mine
I've got something to tell you
I know you're gonna change your mind

When things go wrong
So wrong with you
I hurts me too

I want you baby
Just to understand
I don't want to be your boss, babe
I just want to be your man

Now when you go home
You don't have to get along
Come back to me baby
Well it's where you belong

I love you baby
And you know that it's true
I won't mistreat you baby
Nothin' in this world is like you

So run here baby
Put your little hands in mine
I've got something to tell you
I know you're gonna change your mind
