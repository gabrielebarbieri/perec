I sit in the manner of the ancient Egyptians, 
The palms of the hands softly resting on the legs, 
And the torso erect and natural, 
A minaret pointing to the sky. 
I try to relax and abandon myself, 
To lose all tension 
And anxiety. 

As if I had entered a deep sleep 
But with senses ever more awake and aware; 
A great sense of well-being 
Pervades the body, the heart and my mind 
That so often chains me to its thoughts, 
It chains me. 

Add vision 
With closed eyes, 
Subtract distance 
And discover a third state of being 
That expands and returns, 
Divide the difference.
