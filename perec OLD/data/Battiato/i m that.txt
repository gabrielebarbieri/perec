What glorious light 
wisdom without bound
wrapt in eternal solitary shade 
The impenetrable gloom
of light intense
impervious inaccessible immense

And brought light to the gods and mortal man
my abstinence and renunciation left his heaven to me
you are a hero you are what is ten times more.

We're come from stars? cosmic nature
now we are destroying the future

A real man 
everything is good
inspired by love and wine 

The light which is in me
is now ablaze in me
I come from the first chosen

What joy to breathe the scent of open air
which die like the last rays of the sun
no mortal man has lifted my veil.

I'm neither Muslim nor Hindu 
Non sono mussulmano nè induista
nor Christian nor Buddhist 
nè cristiano nè buddista
I'm not for the hammer 
non sono per il martello
neither for the sickle 
nè per la falce
and even less for the tricolour flame 
nè tanto meno per la fiamma tricolore
because I'm a musician 
perchè sono un musicista
