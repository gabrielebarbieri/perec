Protect me from the forces of evil, 
At night, asleep, when I am unconscious; 
When I am uncertain of my way. 
And never leave me... 
Never, never leave me! 
Bear me up to the loftiest heights 
in one of realms of peace; 
It's time to leave this cycle of life. 
And never leave me... 
Never, never leave me! 
For the joys of the deepest affection, 
Or of the heart's gentiest yearnings 
Are only the shadow of the light. 
Remind me how unhappy I am 
Far from your laws, 
Teach me how not to waste the time that is left to me. 
And never leave me... 
Never,never leave me! 
For the peace I have felt in certain monasteries, 
Or the vibrant joining of all the senses in joyful 
celebration 
Are only the shadow of the light.
