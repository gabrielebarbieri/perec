Oh sweet were the hours, when in mirth's 
frolic throng 
I led up the revds with dance and with song; 
When brisk from the fountain, and bright 
as the day, 
my spirits o'erflow'd, and ran sparkling 
away! 
Wine! Come bring me wine to cheer me, 
Friend of my heart! Come pledge me high! 
Wine! Till the dreams of youth again are 
near me, 
Why must they leave me, tell me, why? 
Retourn, ye sweet hours! Once again let me 
see 
Your airly light forms of enchantment and 
glee- 
Come, give an old friend, while he crowns 
his gay glass, 
A nod as you part and a smile as you 
pass. 
Wine! Come bring me wine... 
I cannot forget you, I would not resign 
There's health in my pulse, and a spdl in my 
wine* 
And sunshine in autumn, tho' passing too 
soon 
Is sweeter and dearer than sunshine in June. 
Wine! Come brin* me wine...
