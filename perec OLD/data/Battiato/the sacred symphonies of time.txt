An idea brings me closer to the sacred symphonies 
Of time: that we are immortal beings 
Fallen into the shadows, destined to sin, 
For centuries upon centuries, until we are made whole. 

Gazing at the horizon, a song of infinity moves me, 
Even if at times, especially in the dark. 
Lunar energy snares my life into apparent uselessness, 
Into total confusion. 

...That we are angels fallen to earth from eternity, 
Without memory: for centuries, for centuries, 
Until we are made whole.
