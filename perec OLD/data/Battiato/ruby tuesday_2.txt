She would never say where she came from 
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone 
While the sun is bright 
Or in the darkest night 
No-one knows 
She comes and goes 
Good-bye Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with ev'ry new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you 
Don't question why she needs to be so free 
She'll tell you it's the only way to be 
She just can't be chained 
To a life where nothing's gained 
And nothing's lost 
At such a cost 
Good-bye Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with ev'ry new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you 
There's no time to lose, I heard her say 
Cash your dreams before they slip away 
Dying all the time 
Lose your dreams and you 
Will lose your mind 
Ain't life unkind 
Good-bye Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with ev'ry new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you.
