Tell me of the existence
Of worlds and planets far away;
Of past civilizations
Of continents gone adrift.
Talk to me about love
Tell me more about human love,
Of anomalous travelers
In magical, mystic territories.

Ahead we followed by instnct
Only the comets trail
As vanguards of another system
In search of the end.

No time, no space
Another race of vibrations,
The sea of the simulation;
Keep your feelings in memory.
I love you
Especially tonight

The air-trafic controllers
Just ready for take-off;
Astrological telescopes
To discover new stars.
Walking Sundays
As a spacer
Ahead.

Ahead we followed by instinct
Only the comets trail
As vanguards of another system
In search of the end.

No time, no space
Another race of vibrations,
The sea of the simulation;
Keep your feelings in memory.
I love you
Especially tonight
