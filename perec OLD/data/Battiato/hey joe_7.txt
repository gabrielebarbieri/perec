Hey Joe, where you goin? with that gun in your hand? 
Hey joe, I said where you goin? with that gun in your hand? 
I?m goin? down to shoot my old lady, 
You know, I caught her messin?round with another man. 
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down, down to the ground 
Ain?t cool 
(Where you gonna run to now? 
Where you, gonna run to? 
Where you, gonna go?) 
I?m going down to Mexico Way where I can be free
