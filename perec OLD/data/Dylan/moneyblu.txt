Sittin' here thinkin'
Where does the money go
Sittin' here thinkin'
Where does the money go
Well, I give it to my woman
She ain't got it no more

Went out last night
Bought two eggs and a slice of ham
Went out last night
Bought two eggs and a slice of ham
Bill came to three dollars and ten cents
And I didn't even get no jam

Man came around
Askin' for the rent
Man came around
Askin' for the rent
Well, I looked into the drawer
But the money's all been spent

Well, well
Ain't got no bank account
Went down to start one
But I didn't have the right amount

Everything's inflated
Like a tire on a car
Everything's inflated
Like a tire on a car
Well, the man came and took my Chevy back
I'm glad I hid my old guitar

Come to me, mama
Ease my money crisis now
Come to me, mama
Ease my money crisis now
I need something to support me.
