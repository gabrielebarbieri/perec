Man of Constant Sorrow,
I've seen trouble all my days.
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised.

Your mother says I'm a stranger;
My face you'll never see no more.
But there's one promise, darling,
I'll see you on God's golden shore.

Through this open world I'm about to ramble,
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain,
I'm about to ride that mornin' railroad,
P'raps I'll die on that train.

I'm going back to Colorado,
The place I started from.
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Honey I never would have come.

Honey, if you don't think I love you
Just look what a fool I been.
And if you don't think I'm sinkin'
Honey, look what a hole I'm in.

It's a hard, hard road to travel
When you can't be satisfied.
I've got a rope that's hanging o'er me
And the devil's at my side.
