I've got a wife and five little children
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
With Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Sarah Jane

Whistle done blows and the fiddler squalls
Captain gone through hole-in-the-wall
Oh Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Sarah Jane

Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels
My gun's steady gonna hold it level
Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
And rock about my Sarah Jane

I've got a wife and five little children
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Sarah Jane (Sarah Jane)
Ain't nothin' to do
