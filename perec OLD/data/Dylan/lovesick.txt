I'm walking,
Through streets that are dead
Walking,
Walking with you in my head

My feet are so tired
My brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

Did I,
Hear someone tell a lie
Did I,
Hear someone's distant cry

I spoke like a child
You destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

I'm sick of love
That I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love
I'm so sick of it

I see,
I see lovers in the meadow
I see,
I see silhouettes in the window

I watch them 'til they're gone
And they leave me hangin' on
To a shadow

I'm sick of love
I hear the clock tick
This kind of love
I'm lovesick

Sometimes
The silence can be like thunder
Sometimes
I wanna take to the road of plunder

Could you ever be true?
I think of you and I wonder

I'm sick of love
I wish I'd never met you
I'm sick of love
I'm tryin' to forget you

Just don't know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you
