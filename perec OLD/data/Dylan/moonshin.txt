I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer

I'll go to some hollow
And set up my still
And if whiskey don't kill
Then I don't know what will

I'll go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend

God bless them pretty women
I wish they were mine
Their breath is as sweet as
The dew on the vine

Let me eat when I'm  hungry
Let me drink when I'm dry
Dollars when I'm hard up
Religion when I die

The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When a bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damm
