You heard about Pharaoh's army
Tramplin' through the mud
You heard about the Hebrew children
Redeemed by blood
Same spirit dwellin' in you
That raised Christ from the dead
You can quicken your mortal body
Then let it run to your head

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, (cover down, break through)

May need protection
By the armour of the Lord
The sword of God is sharper
Than any double sided sword
(He's the hammer of salvation)
(The blade of righteousness)
(Genesis to revelation)
(Repent and confess)

Cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, (cover down, break through)

Well, you wake up early in the mornin'
Turnin' from a-side to side
Somethin' givin' you a warning
You can run but you can't hide
Demands are laid upon you
And burdens a-you can't bear
Sins you can't even remember
I waited to meet you there

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, cover down, break through

You've got an image of yourself
You've built by yourself alone
But it will come a-tumblin' down
Just like the walls are made of stone
You will be separated
From everything you seem to be
You think you'll be liberated
Yeah, but the grave won't set you free

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, cover down, break through

(Cover down, cover down, break through)
(Cover down, cover down, break through)

(Cover down, break through)
(Cover down, oh Lord, cover down, break through)
