Go 'way little boy
I'm not for you
Go back to her
Where you'll be more secure
She knows you better than I do
Go 'way little boy
I'm not for you

Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad
I don't wanna to see you bleed
She's the one that you need
You'll never miss what you ain't never had
Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad

Go 'way little boy
It's much too late
Walk back out the door
Don't wanna see you here no more
You're making it hard for me to concentrate
Go 'way little boy
It's much too late

Can't you hear your mama callin'
Don't you recognize her voice
I think you'd better heed her warning
While you still have the choice

Go 'way little boy
You're much too late
Your future's lookin' bright
Don't throw it away tonight
It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye
Go 'way little boy
Can't you see that you're makin' me cry
